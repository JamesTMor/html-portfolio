<h1>The Best Movies According to James Morgan</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>One of the best on screen adaptations of Batman that we've gotten. The Bruce Wayne is pretty weak, but Robert Pattinson's Batman out weighs that weakness.</p>
<h3>The Avengers</h3>
<p>The markers for a good come together super hero movie. Nothing has quite gotten to the level that this movie was able to achieve with all the heros that we've been growing to love coming together to defend the Earth.</p>
<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>Making someone like the Joker a sympathetic character is no easy achievement, but they were able to do it in Joker. Blending elements of many different thriller movies of the past. This movie is a must watch for anyone, not just comic book lovers.</p>
